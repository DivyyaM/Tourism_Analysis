# Tourism_Analysis
Initially, tourism data was compiled for analysis, emphasizing insights into travel patterns within Maharashtra. Augmentation of the original dataset with synthetic data was performed to refine the dataset. Subsequently, diverse analytical methodologies were applied to derive valuable insights. Furthermore, a recommendation system was developed using Neural Networks, designed to suggest destinations analogous to a specified location within a given district.
